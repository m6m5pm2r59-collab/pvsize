## Current Phase

Phase 5A: Data Validation Guardrail

## Current State

Phase 5A data validation guardrail is implemented. The Opportunities data layer remains schema-only with no real opportunity records, public opportunity pages, sitemap entries, AI import jobs, or newsletter capture flows.

## Completed

- Phase 5-7 master plan created.
- Phase 5-7 runbook created.
- Phase 5-7 status file created.
- Historical Opportunities execution plan located in Obsidian.
- ADR-006 confirmed: opportunities appear after calculator value and trust surfaces.
- `docs/opportunities-architecture-audit.md` created.
- Architecture recommendation recorded: start with a static, file-backed, human-reviewed MVP before database/admin/AI ingestion.
- `src/data/opportunities/` created as a schema-only data directory.
- Opportunity, source, taxonomy, validation, URL, and calculator relation rules defined.
- Empty `opportunities.json` and `sources.json` records arrays created with no published records.
- `src/tools/validate-opportunities.js` added to enforce schema root structure, controlled taxonomy, unique ids/slugs, source quality fields, review-state thresholds, date format, and published-record safety rules.

## Current Constraints

- Do not start public indexed opportunity pages until sample data, validation rules, and source policy are in place.
- Do not invent opportunity data.
- Do not build paid/login features in MVP.
- Do not add AI ingestion or auto-publish before human review workflow exists.

## Last Commit

`a1a9989 Add opportunities data validator`

## Last Verification

Phase 5A validation passed:

- `node -e` JSON parse check for `opportunities.json`, `sources.json`, and `tags.json`
- `git diff --check`
- Schema marker check for opportunity records, review states, validation rules, calculator relation rules, and non-goals
- `node src/tools/validate-opportunities.js`

## Risks And Gaps

- No persistent database or ORM exists.
- No auth/admin system exists.
- Email handling is FormSubmit-based, not newsletter/subscription infrastructure.
- No production scheduler exists for import jobs.
- Analytics is log-based through `/api/event/` and Vercel logs.
- Validation is local-only; it is not wired into an npm script or deployment gate because the repository has no root `package.json`.

## Next Single Task

Create the first Source Registry draft without publishing pages:

Add official-source candidate records to `src/data/opportunities/sources.json` only if they are official, public, and marked `needs_review` or another non-published review state. Do not add opportunity records, public pages, AI import jobs, or sitemap entries.

## User Decision Needed

No immediate decision needed for Phase 5A schema work.
